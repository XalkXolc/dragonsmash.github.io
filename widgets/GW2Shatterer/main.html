						<span class="selcopy squadcast"><span>READY: Run to any one of the launchpads (marked Arrow, Circle, Heart). Don't jump on it yet, just stand on/near it (walking onto it won't launch you). Square marker is for Burns Blunder achievement.</span></span><br />

						<span class="selcopy squadcast"><span>After JUMPing: Use the bomb kit's first skill (a ground-target AoE) on the Shatterer's head once its blue Defiance Bar appears, as this skill will deal heavy damage to it. Throw as many as possible!</span></span><br />
						<span class="selcopy squadcast"><span>Alternatively, if you have access to [&BkftAAA=], those do a similar level of CC to the glider bombs, so feel free to use those once the breakbar shows up as well!</span></span><br />
						<span class="selcopy squadcast"><span>CRYSTALS: Move to a launchpad and jump on it ASAP. Dragon-healing crystals will show up between it and launchpads; again, we'll need glider bombs (and/or other player CC skills) to destroy these.</span></span><br />
						<span class="selcopy squadcast"><span>SLOW DPS: Stop using any other skills than your autoattack (Skill 1). STOP DPS: Rare but important; STOP HITTING the dragon! Its healthbar should come to a full halt, possibly for a long time.</span></span><br />

						<span class="selcopy squadcast"><span>I'll be using six types of commands during this event: READY, JUMP, CRYSTALS, SLOW/STOP DPS, BURN/SMASH, TAG. I'll also mention some OTHER TIPS/TRICKS at the end if we have time.</span></span><br />
						<span class="selcopy squadcast"><span>READY: Run to any one of the launchpads around the area -- waypoint's near two, with a third further to the right. Don't jump on it yet, just stand on/near it (walking onto it won't launch you).</span></span><br />
						<span class="selcopy squadcast"><span>JUMP: Physically jump onto the launchpad and enter glider as soon as it lets you. DO NOT interact (F) with the launchpad, as there's a known bug where it doesn't give you a bomb kit during the fight!</span></span><br />
						<span class="selcopy squadcast"><span>After JUMPing: Use the bomb kit's first skill (a ground-target AoE) on the Shatterer's head once its blue Defiance Bar appears, as this skill will deal heavy damage to it. Throw as many as possible!</span></span><br />
						<span class="selcopy squadcast"><span>CRYSTALS: Move to a launchpad and jump on it ASAP. Dragon-healing crystals will show up between it and launchpads; again, we'll need glider bombs (and/or other player CC skills) to destroy these.</span></span><br />
						<span class="selcopy squadcast"><span>SLOW DPS: Stop using any other skills than your autoattack (Skill 1). STOP DPS: Rare but important; STOP HITTING the dragon! Its healthbar should come to a full halt, possibly for a long time.</span></span><br />
						<span class="selcopy squadcast"><span>BURN: Fire everything! We need his health down fast. SMASH THE DRAGON means the same thing, plus we're aiming to kill it before any other mechanics start.</span></span><br />

<!-- DESIGN MOCKUP for Auto Calltimes:
      | Previous stage, selected time can be clicked and dragged. 
	  | Doing so will automatically adjust future stages, periodically/as-needed finding the best matches with existing timing data.
	  | All of these are dial-like in appearance, popping out of the page?
	  | More stages to the left omitted.
	  | Possible behavior: click-and-drag to spin the underlying dial, a la mouse scrollwheel; also make it follow the user scrollwheel if hovered
	  | 
	  |       | Big shiny button proceeds to the next stage and saves the current stage time automatically
	  |       | 
	  |       |    | Greyed-out preview of next stage.
	  |       |    | Will advance towards screen and gain detail when stage button is pressed.
	  |       |    | Or possibly make it auto-scroll with time, and add a 'lock in' animation when the STAGE button is pressed?

	ALSO CONSIDER:
	 - A "force next stage/force dataset/etc." option. The above is the ideal approach for normal and small delay timings, may not work as well with emergency timings
	 - Should there be a stage for "breakbar observed"? Probably, because that can show up in the data
